The terms of a short-term personal loan are determined by your credit score. If you can gain access to a personal loan, your credit score could affect the loan’s APR, the number of repayment periods in the loan term, and the monthly payment.

Payday loans don’t depend on your credit score, which is why they are favored by workers with very bad credit. Payday lenders use alternative means, such as Teletrack, to evaluate loan requests. Teletrack is a data collector and provider favored by payday lenders.

Conversely, your payday cash advance won’t impact your credit score for better or worse, since payday lenders don’t report your payments to the credit bureaus. However, your credit score will suffer if an instant payday loan goes into collection or default, information that will be added to your credit report.
